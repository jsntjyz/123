# Create a Gazebo map from the occupancy map
Quick note before following these instructions make sure, that your desired map image does not contain expendable pixels around the border, like in the following picture. These pixels will not be a part of the resulting mesh, but they influence it's dimensions, as our script reads the image's height and width. If these borders are big enough, the outcome will be a misaligned world with respect to the map. In order to avoid this problem, you can try trimming the map image with Imagemagick like this, to overwrite the existing image:
```bash
convert map_image -trim map_image
```

Creating a Gazebo map from the 2D occupancy map, created by *arena-tools* can be broken down into six steps

❶ [Transform the `pgm` file into an `svg`](#1-transform-the-pgm-file-into-an-svg)

❷ [Open the `svg` in Blender](#2-open-the-svg-in-blender)

❸ [Scale and Extrude the `svg`](#3-scale-and-extrude-the-svg)

❹ [Convert to `mesh`](#4-convert-to-mesh)

❺ [(Optinal) simplify the world for higher simulation speed](#5-optinal-simplify-the-world-for-higher-simulation-speed)

❻ [Include the mesh into the world file and save the file](#6-include-the-mesh-into-the-world-file-and-save-the-file)

### 1. Transform the `pgm` file into an `svg`
Use *Incspace* to transform the image to an `svg`

### 2. Open the `svg` in Blender
Open *Blender*, clear the scene and import the `svg`

### 3. Scale and Extrude the `svg`
When working with *arena-tools* worlds have a size of 25x25m. You can determine this by multiplying the resolution (pixel per meter) with the number of pixels.

### 4. Convert to `mesh`
Right-click and select, convert to `mesh`

### 5. (Optinal) simplify the world for higher simulation speed
The gazebo simulation-speed can be increased by decreasing the model complexity in this case the number of wires. This can be done with the *decimate* tool. 
> **NOTE**: Don't reduce the number to much, so that structural integrety of the map stays intact

### 6. Include the mesh into the world file and save the file
Create a new world folder under: <code>simulator_setup/worlds/<var>WORLD_NAME</var></code>. Export the mesh object in `dae` format under the name `map.dae`. Download the `.world` file into that folder. You can run the code below:
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
roscd simulator_setup/worlds/<var>WORLD_NAME</var>
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignc-research/arena-tools/main/map_to_gazebo/map.world
</pre>
